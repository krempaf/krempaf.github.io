	<p>Data from the Billion Oyster Project, a plan to bring one billion oysters to New York Harbor by 2035, shows the organization’s hard work is paying off.</p>
	<p>According to research published in their <a href="https://billionoysterproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TNC_BOP_NYC_2018_Oyster_Monitoring.pdf">2018 New York City Oyster Monitoring Report</a>, many BOP reefs, like the Lemon Creek Nursery and the Great Kills Harbor Nursery, have grown since initial installation. The Billion Oyster Project intends to restore the 220,000 acres of natural oyster habitats that once sustained the city’s waterways and currently maintains seven official reefs while partnering with community organizations and independent ecologists to manage individual research stations.</p>
	<p>Why oysters? They’re best known for their impact on water purification. As filter-feeders, they remove organic and inorganic particles, such as excess nitrogen, sediments and pollutants. They pack a powerful punch: Individual adult mollusks can filter up to 50 gallons of water per day, making them a keystone species in many aquatic environments.</p>
	<p>Ann Fraioli, director of education for the Billion Oyster Project, explained that oysters can play an important part in habitat creation and biodiversity influence—especially in waterways in transition zones that need revival, like the harbor and its surrounding waterways. “An estuary is supposed to be a nursery for sea life. It’s a place where, traditionally, animals come to raise young and find food,” Fraioli said. “As soon as you put an oyster structure, or if you had a natural oyster reef in the water, you immediately start to attract all of this biodiversity…that's the most immediate benefit.”</p>

		Key Takeaways:
	</div>
	<p><b>- Lemon Creek Nursery saw the greatest growth in oysters, with shell height expanding 51.07% from 2017 to 2018.</b></p>
	<p><b>- Contrarily, the Governors Island Reef saw a reduction in shell height, decreasing 1.60% year over year.</b></p>
	<p><b>- Some reefs, like the Canarsie Community Reef at Paerdegat Basin and Coney Island Community Reef are less than a year old, making annual growth data unavailable.</b></p>
